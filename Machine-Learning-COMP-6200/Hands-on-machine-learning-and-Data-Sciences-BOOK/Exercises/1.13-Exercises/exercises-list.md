- [x] Write a Python program that takes an input as length in centimeters and converts it to meters and kilometers.

## 2. Mathematical Operations
2. Write a Python program that takes two numbers from the user and finds their power, that is, \( x^y \).

## 3. Loops and Iterations
3. Write a Python program to print all natural numbers in reverse from `n` to 1 using a for loop.  
4. Write a Python program to print alphabets from `a` to `z` using a for loop.  
5. Write a Python program that takes a number from the user and prints the multiplication table of the given number using a for loop.  
6. Write a Python program that takes a number and checks whether the number is a prime number or not using a for loop.

## 4. String and Character Operations
7. Write a Python program to count the frequency of characters in a given sentence.  
8. Write a Python program to print ASCII values of all characters using a for loop.

## 5. Functions
9. Write a Python function `isMultiple` that takes two integers, `n` and `m`, and returns `True` if and only if `n` is a multiple of `m`, that is, \( n = m \times k \) for some integer `k`.  
10. Write a Python function `isEven` that takes an integer `n` and returns `True` if and only if `n` is even.  
11. Write a Python function that takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.  
12. Write a Python function that takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of all the odd positive integers less than or equal to `n`.  
13. Write a Python function that takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of the squares of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

## 6. String Manipulation
14. Write a Python function that counts the number of vowels in a given character string.  
15. Write a Python function that removes all the punctuation from a string `s` storing a sentence, for example, transforming the string `"Let’s do it, Joe!"` to `"Lets do it Joe"`.

## 7. Object-Oriented Programming
16. Write a Python class `StudentInfo` that has five instance variables of type `int`, `str`, `str`, `str`, and `float`, which respectively represent the student ID, name, address, phone number, and tuition.  
   - The class must include a constructor method that initializes each variable to an appropriate value.
   - The class should include methods for setting the value of each variable and getting the value of each variable.

17. Write a Python class `CarInfo` that has three instance variables of type `int`, `str`, and `float`, which respectively represent the year, maker, and price.  
   - The class must include a constructor method that initializes each variable to an appropriate value.
   - The class should include methods for setting the value of each variable and getting the value of each variable.
